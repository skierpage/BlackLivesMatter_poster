# BlackLivesMatter_poster
_a Black Lives Matter poster you can print out_

It is the least I could do; [downloading this PDF](Black_Lives_Matter_LO.pdf) and printing out the first three pages is the least you can do.

![the three pages of the PDF poster](https://www.skierpage.com/images/design/Black_Lives_Matter.png)

I made it in the free and open source [LibreOffice program](https://www.libreoffice.org/), using the fonts [Cantarell Extra Bold](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/cantarell-fonts/) and [Dobkin Script](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/dobkin-script-font/), that are, roughly, free to install for personal use. I filled in the ‘v’ in “Lives” using the free and open source [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) program to edit the text as a vector drawing, then inserted the resulting SVG [Black Lives Matter Lives heart.svg](Black%20Lives%20Matter%20Lives%20heart.svg) as page 2.

Cantarell was originally designed by [Dave Crossland](http://understandingfonts.com/who/dave-crossland/) as part of his coursework for the MA Typeface Design program at the [Department of Typography in the University of Reading, England](https://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/). The GNOME user interface uses it, so it might already be installed if you use Linux. In Fedora Workstation, I think the font is pre-installed in the `abattis-cantarell-fonts` package. Dobkin Script was released in 2003 by [Dieter Steffmann](https://www.fontspace.com/dieter-steffmann) and is licensed for personal and commercial-use

If you want to edit the pages, open the PDF in LibreOffice Writer, there are more notes on its last page (page 4). You might want to do this to print on different paper than USA letter, or make improvements. You'll need to install the fonts if you want to change the text. Feel free to open an issue if you see a need for improvements, or make one of your own, or just tweet @skierpage.
