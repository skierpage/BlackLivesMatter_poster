# BlackLivesMatter_poster

It is the least I could do; [downloading this PDF](https://www.skierpage.com/media/Black_Lives_Matter_LO.pdf) and printing out the first three pages is the least you can do.

I made it in the free and open source LibreOffice program, using the fonts Cantarell Extra Bold and Dobkin Script , they are free to install. I filled in the ‘v’ in “Lives” using the free and open source Inkscape program.
